    <h3>REVIEW</h3>
    <p>At home we love pasta, it is simply hearing pasta and start salivating and thinking about how many combinations
        can be prepared and which one is more delicious. With pasta you can innovate as much as you want and I love that
        but I admit that when I think of the most classic recipes I always want to prepare them, like today.

        Prepare with our recipe a delicious spaghetti Bolognese, certainly a pasta recipe to succeed and that usually
        everyone likes. It is an authentic marvel the combination of a stir-fry of vegetables, minced meat of good
        quality and the tomato sauce, in addition to herbs and spices that give it the definitive touch and the best of
        everything, the easy thing that is to prepare.

        And it is not only with spaghetti, Bolognese sauce is very versatile and that is why I love to prepare a large
        amount to freeze it in portions and have it always available because it can be used in many recipes such as
        baked stuffed mushrooms, cooking eggplant stuffed with minced meat in the microwave or launch into international
        cuisine and prepare a tasty moussaka or Greek moussaka or a homemade calzone pizza with Bolognese sauce and
        vegetables.

        If you love pasta you will enjoy our selection of pasta recipes, among which you will find another very similar
        to this one, rigatoni with Bolognese sauce, as well as others as popular as meat lasagna Bolognese, vegetable
        lasagna, baked macaroni au gratin, classic spaghetti carbonara (and the non-traditional version of spaghetti
        carbonara with cream), macaroni with Roquefort sauce, spaghetti with shrimp, pasta Alfredo with its famous
        sauce, minced meat cannelloni with fresh pasta and a very special recipe with homemade sauce, tagliatelle with
        pesto sauce. You can even learn how to make your own fresh pasta at home and my most special recipe, Scandal
        macaroni with mustard bechamel and cheese, delicious!
