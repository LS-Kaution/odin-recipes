    <h3>AND THE FINAL CHALLENGE, THE PREPARATION</h3>
    <p>To start preparing the bolognese sauce first peel the onion and chop it finely.<br>
        <br>
        Peel the carrot with the help of a potato peeler, cut it in the middle and chop it finely as you have done with
        the onion.<br>
        <br>
        To cook the sauce I recommend you to use a pot because, besides cooking the sauce in it, I like to add the pasta
        at the end to mix it all together there and to be able to serve it directly on the plates of the guests.<br>
        <br>
        Pour a little oil into the pot and put it over medium-low heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion and the
        carrot together with a little salt and cook them for about 10 minutes or until they are tender. The idea is that
        they barely brown so if that happens and they are still not tender, lower the heat. If it gets a little out of
        hand and they are browning too much or burning you can always, in addition to lowering the heat, add a little
        water.<br>
        <br>
        Add the minced meat, mix it with the rest of the ingredients and use a spatula to separate it so that it does
        not stick together in large pieces. Add salt, freshly ground black pepper and oregano to taste.<br> 
        <br>
        When the meat is no longer pink, increase the heat to high, add the white wine and wait for the alcohol to
        evaporate, it will only take 2-3 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Lower the heat so that it is soft and add the tomato sauce and the milk and let it cook for 20 minutes so that
        the flavors merge and the meat is tender. If as the cooking progresses you want to add more tomato sauce, there
        is no problem to add it at the moment you prefer. And when you have it ready, don't forget to taste it in case
        you need to correct the salt or add more oregano or pepper.<br>
        <br>
        When the Bolognese sauce is almost ready, you can start preparing the pasta. Put abundant water to boil in a pot
        over high heat.<br>
        <br>
        When the water boils, add a teaspoon of salt and the spaghetti, and as soon as the water boils again (it will
        take very little time) start counting the minutes indicated on the package. In my case it has been 8 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        When the spaghetti is ready, place it in a colander in the sink to drain the water.<br>
        <br>
        Add the spaghetti to the Bolognese sauce pot with the heat off, mix well and they are ready.<br>
        <br>
